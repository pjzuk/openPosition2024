# openPosition2024

post-doc job opening in OpenFOAM and thermal porous media conversion, based in Warsaw, Poland.

Task to show the knowledge of OpenFOAM:

Please create the solver that is based on scalarTransportFoam with the following additional functionality:

The solver should read from a dictionary in a constant folder the coordinates of two points P1, P2 and a number S. Next, the solver should determine two computational cells, C1 and C2 , which have cell centres closest to the points P1, and P2. Next, the solver should determine the shortest face-connected path between those cells. It should work in serial and parallel modes. Finally, the determined path should become a location of a source term of intensity S within the scalar transport equation solved like in scalarTransportFoam solver.
Please provide a solver with a simple working test case. 

The solution can be emailed alongside all documents to the email address indicated in the job offer below. Although it is not necessary, it will significantly help candidates to present their qualifications for the position.
